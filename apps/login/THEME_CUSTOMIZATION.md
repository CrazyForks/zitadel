- **`side-by-side`** - Brand section on left, form on right (desktop view)
- **`top-to-bottom`** - Brand section on top, form below (mobile-first)

### üé® Preset (`NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_PRESET`)

Complete color schemes and styling:

- **`professional`** - Blue-based corporate theme

- **`minimal`** - Clean black and white design

### üñºÔ∏è Background Image (`NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_BACKGROUND_IMAGE`)

Add a custom background image:

- Use local images: `/images/my-background.jpg` (place in `public/images/`)

- Leave empty for solid color backgrounds

## Example Configurations

### Tech Startup

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_ROUNDNESS=full
NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_LAYOUT=side-by-side
NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_PRESET=modern
NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_BACKGROUND_IMAGE=/images/tech-gradient.jpg
```

```

## Advanced Customization

For more detailed customization beyond these presets, you can:

1. **Custom CSS**: Add your own CSS files in the `src/styles/` directory
2. **Component Override**: Modify the theme configuration in `src/lib/theme.ts`
3. **Custom Presets**: Add new preset options to the `PRESET_STYLES` object

## Troubleshooting

### Theme not applying

- Ensure you're using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for all theme variables
- Restart your development server after changing environment variables
- Check that your `.env.local` file is in the root of the login app directory

### Background image not loading

- Verify the image path is correct
- For external URLs, ensure the domain is accessible
- Check browser console for any loading errors

### Layout issues on mobile

- Test your theme on different screen sizes
- The `top-to-bottom` layout is generally more mobile-friendly
- Some combinations work better on certain screen sizes
