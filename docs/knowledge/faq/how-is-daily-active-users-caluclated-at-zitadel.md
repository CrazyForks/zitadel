# How is Daily Active Users calculated?

## Overview

Understanding how ZITADEL calculates DAUs (Daily Active users) at a deeper level. 

## Solution

At ZITADEL we assess the number of daily active users by day, and then use the sum total over the course of the month.

Example: If you have 1 user who authenticates each day per month (30 days), this would sum up to 30 daily active users; In the event you have 5 users, each user authenticates one time per week over the course of 4 weeks, this would calculate as 25 daily active users.
