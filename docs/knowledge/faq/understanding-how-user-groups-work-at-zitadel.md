# Understanding how user groups work at ZITADEL

## Overview

The goal is to pair users together based on specific criteria or attributes

## Solution

While there isn't a traditional Group feature, there are two potential workflows for accomplishing the same result.

* 1st Workflow: As a ZITADEL admin, you have the ability to add metadata with the group name to the User to generate the association.
* 2nd Workflow: There is also the function of leveraging the roles within a project such as "group1" or "group2", however that would be limited to the context of that specific project.
