    # Format is used for all streams that have no other Format explicitly configured.
    # Possible values for Format:
    # "text", "json", "flat_snake", "proto_json"
    # The default format is "flat_snake"

    # This makes them easy to access in any log collection rule.
    # Also, it allows to map record fields directly to easily accessible database columns.
