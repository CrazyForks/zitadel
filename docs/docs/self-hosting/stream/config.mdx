Use the tools you already have running to consume your Zitadel data.

In the Zitadel source code, Golangs standard logging library slog is used to write stream records.
Stream records can be considered as a subset of application logs.
The terminology "stream records" helps differentiate these logs from conventional application logs.
Unlike conventional application logs, stream records have strong schema guarantees and various configuration options.
This empowers you to easily distribute your Zitadel data throughout your diverse ecosystem.
All you need to ingest streams from Zitadels stdout into your favourite storage system is a running log collector.

## Configure Zitadel Logs

```yaml
Log:
  # Possible values for Level with Format zitadel:
  # "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
  # The default level is "info"
  # If the value is higher than "info", all streams except partially the Exceptions stream are disabled.
  # Only Exception records for runtime errors or warnings have a higher severity than "info",
  # Exception records for user errors have severity "info".
  Level: "info"
  Formatter:
    # Possible values for Format:
    # "text", "json", "zitadel"
    # The default format is "zitadel"
    # "json" and "zitadel" formatted records are written as ndjson (newline delimited JSON)
    Format: "zitadel"
  Data:
    FieldMap: # FieldMap is undefined by default
      message: "msg" # prints the Records "message" at the key "message"
      service: "serviceContext.service" # prints the Records "service" field in a group "serviceContext" at the "service" key
      version: "serviceContext.version" # prints the Records "version" field in a group "serviceContext" at the "version" key
      exception.description: "error" # prints the Exceptions stream records "description" field at the root level at the "error" key
  Streams:
    # By default, all streams are disabled. Set this to true to change this default for all streams.
    Enabled: # false by default for all streams
    # Possible values for SensitiveFields:
    # "redact", "remove", "write"
    SensitiveFields: "redact"
    # Possible values for PersonallyIdentifiableInformation
    # "redact", "anonymize", "remove", "write"
    PersonallyIdentifiableInformation: "redact"
    # Possible values for Format are "protojson", "otel" and "google_cloud_logging". Default is "protojson"
    Format: "otel"
    # Possible values for RecordVersion: "latest", "v1"
    RecordVersion: "latest"
    VersionedRecord: true # Wraps the record with an enumerable property key indicating the records version. Is true by default.
    Outputs:
    - Channel: "Stderr"
       Enabled: true # By default, only the Stderr channel is enabled
    - Channel: "Stdout"
      Enabled: false
    # - Channel: "GRPC"
    #   Enabled: false # support for setting Enabled to true for this Channel is ðŸš§ under construction
    #   Config:
    #     Target: "example.com:443"
    #     Headers:
    #       "X-My-Auth-Header": "my symmetric key"
    # - Channel: "HTTPS" # ðŸš§ under construction
    # - Channel: "ClickHouse" # ðŸš§ under construction
    # - Channel: "S3" # ðŸš§ under construction
    # - Channel: "GCS" # ðŸš§ under construction
    Types:
    - Type: "Exceptions"
      Enabled: true # Is false by default
      SensitiveFields: "remove" # Overwrites default component stream config value of "redact"
      PersonallyIdentifiableInformation: # Inherits "redact" from default component stream config
      Format: "protojson"
      RecordVersion: "latest" # Possible values: "latest", "v1"
      VersionedRecord: true # Wraps the record with an enumerable property key indicating the records version. Is true by default.
      Outputs: # Inherits Outputs from default component stream config
    - Type: "HTTPRequests"
      # Inherit Zitadel defaults (disabled, redacted sensitive and PII data to stdout)
      # All options like Exceptions
      # The same applies to all other streams
    - Type: "APICalls"
      Format: "otel"
      # The same stream can be written multiple times with different configurations
    - Type: "APICalls"
      Format: "raw"
    - Type: "Authentications"
    - Type: "Authorizations"
    # - Type: "Events" # ðŸš§ under construction
    # - Type: "Actions" # ðŸš§ under construction
